Tubtim Jade Gems was born 14 years ago in a small shop at Collyer Quay, Raffles Place Singapore (with the name “Nature’s Treasures").  The main purpose of having a shop was to be able to take care my children any time they needed me.  At the beginning, I had no idea what to sell.  I loved to buy and wear jewelry since young. but I never realized jewelry is in my blood until I found my shop to be full with only gemstones and jewelry.  Recalling my early childhood, I used to wear so many rings that my primary school teacher teased me, “Why not wear 2 more thumb rings to complete the set?” Also, I always enjoyed looking at gemstones my mom bought and showed me since young.  Possibly, I get the gemstone blood from my mom.  I would like to thank her for buying and collecting gemstones for me to play with now.

In the past, I have mistakenly bought many gemstones with inaccurate information from sellers.  For example, the natural grade A jade but with no mention of cleaning away dirt with chemicals (actually Jade B), heated Ruby (but actually glass-filled ruby), no-heat Madagascar blue sapphire at Myanmar sapphire price or turquoise (with dyed substances to enhance color).  So, from these experiences, I have collected the gemstones with only natural properties as much as possible.  I do not want my customers to have an unpleasant experience like I did.  Thus, I’ve conducted my business with accurate information of the properties of each gemstone to the best of my knowledge.  

 In the very early beginning, I bought jewelry from suppliers to resell.  I would like to thank all my first customers who trusted me to commission specially made-to-order pieces. These assignments exposed my hidden talent and gave me the push that I needed, to have my own designs to reflect my character. Once again, thank you to my customers who have supported my designs.  My confidence has grown but I still feel I am a novice now.  I promise myself, I will keep developing my design with the concept of “Simply & Gracefully” with a focus on wearable comfort, and with the most natural gemstones. 

I strongly believe that fine workmanship makes a big difference in “jewelry and FINE jewelry”.  Every jeweler can make jewelry but only 10% of jewelers can make fine jewelry.  I would thank you God who has sent me a team of fine jewelers who are proud to make only good work.  I also want to thank my team for their dedication to fine workmanship and their great teamwork. 

In December 2019, Tubtim Jade Gems opened in Jatujak Plaza, Bangkok as a manufacturing base.

Every piece from Tubtim Jade Gems is created with attention, passion and (the whole) heart from the first step of designing, gemstones picking, laying, …  till the last step of delivering to customers.

I sincerely thank you,
